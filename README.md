# Intro_To_Computation_And_Programming_Using_Python_John_V_Guttag
<br>

Hello World! This repository will contain the chapter codes and finger exercises obtained from the book Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python by John V. Guttag. 
<br>
This repo may serve as a guide for anyone using this textbook, but gets stuck on a finger exercise.
<br>
I am merely using this resource to improve my programming skills, as such, better solutions to problems may exist.
